    * Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

    Example:

    Input:
    [
      ["1","0","1","0","0"],
      ["1","0","1","1","1"],
      ["1","1","1","1","1"],
      ["1","0","0","1","0"]
    ]
    Output: 6
    *
    * Idea:
    * - Iteratively try expanding the area of the rectangle in question
    * - Do 2 checks
    *   - First by going right then down and calculating area
    *   - Second by going down then right and calculating area
