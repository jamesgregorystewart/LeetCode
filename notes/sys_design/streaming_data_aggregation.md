# Designs When Building Data Aggregation Services in Realtime Environment

### Architecting an Ad Click Event Aggregation Service Using Kafka Streams and RocksDB

When designing an ad click event aggregation service that leverages Kafka Streams and RocksDB, the goal is to efficiently process and store real-time ad click data, and then provide APIs to query aggregated data, such as the most clicked ads over a given time period or the number of clicks a specific ad received.

#### System Components:

1. **Kafka**: Acts as the central messaging backbone. Ad click events are published to Kafka topics.
2. **Kafka Streams**: Processes streams of ad click events for real-time aggregation.
3. **RocksDB**: An embedded database used by Kafka Streams to store state locally for each stream processing task.
4. **API Layer**: Exposes the aggregated data to clients, potentially through RESTful endpoints.

#### Detailed Steps and Considerations:

### 1. Kafka Topic Configuration

- **Partitioning**: Topics should be partitioned to allow for scalable parallel processing. The number of partitions might depend on the expected volume of events and the computational resources available.

### 2. Kafka Streams Application

- **Stream Processing**: Kafka Streams applications read from the Kafka topics, perform transformations, aggregations, and maintain state using `KTable`s and `KStream`s.

  ```java
  StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
  KStream<String, ClickEvent> clicks = builder.stream("click-events-topic");
  KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> aggregatedClicks = clicks
      .map((key, value) -> new KeyValue<>(value.getAdId(), value))
      .groupByKey()
      .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
      .count(Materialized.as("ad-clicks-store"));
  ```

- **Tumbling Window Aggregation**: Using time-based tumbling windows to aggregate click events over fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

- **State Stores and RocksDB**: Each Kafka Streams task has its own instance of RocksDB, where it stores the state required for processing (e.g., counts of clicks per ad).

### 3. Querying the State Stores

- **Interactive Queries**: To access the state distributed across multiple Kafka Streams instances, use interactive queries. Each instance exposes an endpoint for querying its local state store.

  ```java
  ReadOnlyWindowStore<String, Long> windowStore =
      streams.store(StoreQueryParameters.fromNameAndType("ad-clicks-store", QueryableStoreTypes.windowStore()));
  ```

- **Service Discovery**: Implement service discovery to keep track of which Kafka Streams instance holds which part of the data.

### 4. API Layer

- **Endpoint Implementation**: Create API endpoints that perform the necessary interactive queries across Kafka Streams instances.
- **Aggregating Results**: For queries that require data from multiple instances, the API service aggregates results from several streams applications.

### 5. Fault Tolerance and Scalability

- **Changelog Topics**: Kafka Streams uses changelog topics in Kafka to back up the state in RocksDB, ensuring that state can be restored in case of a failure.
- **Scaling Out**: Add more Kafka Streams instances to handle higher loads. Kafkaâ€™s partitioning automatically helps distribute the workload across new instances.

### 6. Monitoring and Management

- **Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like JMX, Prometheus, and Grafana to monitor the performance and health of Kafka, Kafka Streams, and the API layer.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize RocksDB settings within Kafka Streams using `RocksDBConfigSetter` for better performance.

### Conclusion

This architecture leverages Kafka for durable message ingestion, Kafka Streams for real-time data processing and aggregation, and RocksDB for efficient state management. Interactive Queries facilitate distributed data access, essential for building a scalable ad click event aggregation service. Through careful design around data partitioning, state management, and query architecture, this system can handle high volumes of data with low latency queries, providing timely insights into ad performance metrics.
