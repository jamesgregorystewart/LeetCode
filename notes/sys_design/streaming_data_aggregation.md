# Designs When Building Data Aggregation Services in Realtime Environment

### Architecting an Ad Click Event Aggregation Service Using Kafka Streams and RocksDB

When designing an ad click event aggregation service that leverages Kafka Streams and RocksDB, the goal is to efficiently process and store real-time ad click data, and then provide APIs to query aggregated data, such as the most clicked ads over a given time period or the number of clicks a specific ad received.

#### System Components:

1. **Kafka**: Acts as the central messaging backbone. Ad click events are published to Kafka topics.
2. **Kafka Streams**: Processes streams of ad click events for real-time aggregation.
3. **RocksDB**: An embedded database used by Kafka Streams to store state locally for each stream processing task.
4. **API Layer**: Exposes the aggregated data to clients, potentially through RESTful endpoints.

#### Detailed Steps and Considerations:

### 1. Kafka Topic Configuration

- **Partitioning**: Topics should be partitioned to allow for scalable parallel processing. The number of partitions might depend on the expected volume of events and the computational resources available.

### 2. Kafka Streams Application

- **Stream Processing**: Kafka Streams applications read from the Kafka topics, perform transformations, aggregations, and maintain state using `KTable`s and `KStream`s.

  ```java
  StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
  KStream<String, ClickEvent> clicks = builder.stream("click-events-topic");
  KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> aggregatedClicks = clicks
      .map((key, value) -> new KeyValue<>(value.getAdId(), value))
      .groupByKey()
      .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
      .count(Materialized.as("ad-clicks-store"));
  ```

- **Tumbling Window Aggregation**: Using time-based tumbling windows to aggregate click events over fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

- **State Stores and RocksDB**: Each Kafka Streams task has its own instance of RocksDB, where it stores the state required for processing (e.g., counts of clicks per ad).

### 3. Querying the State Stores

- **Interactive Queries**: To access the state distributed across multiple Kafka Streams instances, use interactive queries. Each instance exposes an endpoint for querying its local state store.

  ```java
  ReadOnlyWindowStore<String, Long> windowStore =
      streams.store(StoreQueryParameters.fromNameAndType("ad-clicks-store", QueryableStoreTypes.windowStore()));
  ```

- **Service Discovery**: Implement service discovery to keep track of which Kafka Streams instance holds which part of the data.

### 4. API Layer

- **Endpoint Implementation**: Create API endpoints that perform the necessary interactive queries across Kafka Streams instances.
- **Aggregating Results**: For queries that require data from multiple instances, the API service aggregates results from several streams applications.

### 5. Fault Tolerance and Scalability

- **Changelog Topics**: Kafka Streams uses changelog topics in Kafka to back up the state in RocksDB, ensuring that state can be restored in case of a failure.
- **Scaling Out**: Add more Kafka Streams instances to handle higher loads. Kafka’s partitioning automatically helps distribute the workload across new instances.

### 6. Monitoring and Management

- **Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like JMX, Prometheus, and Grafana to monitor the performance and health of Kafka, Kafka Streams, and the API layer.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize RocksDB settings within Kafka Streams using `RocksDBConfigSetter` for better performance.

### Conclusion

This architecture leverages Kafka for durable message ingestion, Kafka Streams for real-time data processing and aggregation, and RocksDB for efficient state management. Interactive Queries facilitate distributed data access, essential for building a scalable ad click event aggregation service. Through careful design around data partitioning, state management, and query architecture, this system can handle high volumes of data with low latency queries, providing timely insights into ad performance metrics.


### Handling High Read Volumes in a Sequential Data Processing System with Kafka Streams and RocksDB

When designing systems that process data sequentially without partitioning, scalability, particularly for read operations, can become a significant challenge. Here are detailed approaches and considerations for managing high read volumes when using Kafka Streams with an embedded RocksDB state store, where data must remain strictly sequential:

#### Option 1: Vertical Scaling and Optimization

- **Resource Enhancement**: Increase the compute resources such as CPU and RAM to handle more operations concurrently.
- **RocksDB Tuning**: Adjust RocksDB configurations for better performance under heavy read load. This can include increasing cache sizes and optimizing compaction strategies.

#### Option 2: Decoupling Read Load Using Kafka Topics

- **Stream to New Topic**: After processing the data in a Java streaming application, write the outputs to a new Kafka topic. This approach separates the processing load from the read load.
- **Utilize Scalable Storage Solutions**: Leverage scalable read-optimized data stores such as Apache Cassandra or Redis. These systems are designed for high read throughput and horizontal scalability.
- **Data Consumption**: Develop a service or services that consume data from this new Kafka topic and maintain it in the scalable store, serving as a high-performance backend for read-heavy operations.

#### Option 3: Replicate RocksDB State for Read Distribution

- **Manual Replication**: Though Kafka Streams does not natively support replication across RocksDB instances, you can create multiple instances of your Kafka Streams application, each consuming the same Kafka topic and building its own local RocksDB state.
- **Distributed Reads**: Implement a load balancing or smart routing mechanism to distribute read queries across these replicated RocksDB instances. This increases complexity but might be required to achieve the desired scalability and performance.

#### Key Considerations

- **Trade-off Between Complexity and Performance**: Any architectural changes to address scalability will add complexity. Assess whether the potential performance improvements justify this added complexity.
- **Maintaining Data Consistency**: With new components or replication strategies, it’s crucial to ensure that the system still adheres to the strict sequential data processing and consistency requirements.
- **Benchmarking**: Perform thorough testing and benchmarking of the current system and any proposed changes. This helps to understand the impact of these changes and ensures that they meet the required performance criteria.

#### Conclusion

Scaling a system that processes data sequentially and is limited to a single RocksDB instance for state management requires thoughtful architecture adjustments. Depending on the system's specific needs and operational constraints, you can choose to vertically scale and optimize the existing setup, decouple processing and reading loads through additional Kafka topics, or implement a replication strategy for RocksDB. Each approach has its own benefits and challenges, and the right choice depends on the system’s unique requirements and the acceptable level of complexity for the infrastructure.
