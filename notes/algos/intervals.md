# Intervals

It is frequently useful to sort inputs of interval problems. Additional tools to use would be bisect and priority queues.

Interval problems with non-sorted inputs typically have a time complexity of O(nlogn) or similar.

Prefix sums may also be of use. Count how many occurences of each sum exist.
