# Palindromes

## Approaches
Approaches to consider when solving a Palindrome problem:

1. Brute Force: O(N^3) / O(1)
2. Dynamic Programming: O(N^2) / O(N^2)
3. Expand around Center: O(N^2) / O(1)

There are other more complex, sub-quadratic solutions which would be difficult to implment in an interview.
